# My Old Projects, 2015-2019

These are all of my projects up to June 2019, dug from the depths of my code partition. All are `git`-less, some dysfunctional.

## C++ Time

When: unclear

Literally just a "hello" program which also declares a `double`, compiled. I guess I wanted to learn C++ from a book but it never really took off

## bash_history

When: June 2019

`.bash_history` stats: creates a [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) chart of most used commands (crude splitting but useful)
