# My Old Projects, 2015-2019

These are all of my projects up to June 2019, dug from the depths of my code partition. All are `git`-less, some dysfunctional.

## C++ Time

When: unclear

Literally just a "hello" program which also declares a `double`, compiled. I guess I wanted to learn C++ from a book but it never really took off

## bash_history

When: June 2019

`.bash_history` stats: creates a [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) chart of most used commands (crude splitting but useful)

## mtt

When: June 2019

[Mind the Time](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mind-the-time/) stats: only prints total time in browser, and opens an empty [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) graph.

## jKeypad

When: 2018

My attempt at a calculator for how many keystrokes a string would need on my old phone (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_E1200). I made some weird "state" thing for different typing modes (number mode, symbol mode), and nothing else really happened. I think I made a more complete JavaScript version - I'll have to look for it

## jobs

When: 2019

Me reviewing some programming languages (cos I was excited)

## sonnet_generator

When: 2019

I tried to make a node program to write sonnets from KJV Bible fragments - tried loads of bible `txt` files and libraries for splitting syllables, with no success. Would've been weird

## random_aw
