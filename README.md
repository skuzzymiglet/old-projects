# My Old Projects, 2015-2019

These are all of my projects up to June 2019, dug from the depths of my code partition. All are `git`-less, some dysfunctional.

## C++ Time

When: unclear

Literally just a "hello" program which also declares a `double`, compiled. I guess I wanted to learn C++ from a book but it never really took off

## bash_history

When: June 2019

`.bash_history` stats: creates a [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) chart of most used commands (crude splitting but useful)

## mtt

When: June 2019

[Mind the Time](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mind-the-time/) stats: only prints total time in browser, and opens an empty [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) graph.

## jKeypad

When: 2018

My attempt at a calculator for how many keystrokes a string would need on my old phone (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_E1200). I made some weird "state" thing for different typing modes (number mode, symbol mode), and nothing else really happened. I think I made a more complete JavaScript version - I'll have to look for it

## jobs

When: 2019

Me reviewing some programming languages (cos I was excited)

## sonnet_generator

When: 2019

I tried to make a node program to write sonnets from KJV Bible fragments - tried loads of bible `txt` files and libraries for splitting syllables, with no success. Would've been weird

## random_aw

When: 2019

A python script that grabs the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) table of contents, searches for links and opens a random one with the `webbrowser` module. You could just visit https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Special:Random though!

## practical

When: 2017 and 2018

Contains some "practical" scripts of mine:

### cpu_load_blinkt.py

When: 2017

A [Blinkt!](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/blinkt) CPU load indicator for the Raspberry Pi - more LEDs for more CPU load, also coloring:

| Load       | Color
|------------|--------|
| 0-37.5%    | Green  |
| 37.5-62.5% | Orange |
| 62.5-100%  | Red    |

### py-timer.py

When: 2018

A [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) program that printed uptime in [3Dumb](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/3Dumb), a font I used for literally every pygame thing back then.
