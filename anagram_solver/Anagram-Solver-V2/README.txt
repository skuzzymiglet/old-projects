Whereas the prevoius algorithm:

1 Scrambled the word
2 Searched the wordlist for it
3 Goto 1 if not found

Output:

It's more efficient and also more intelligent now:

1 Get all combinations
2 Get all case sequences
3 Search wordlist > More than one answer can be given!

BETWEEN SOLUTIONS IT ASKS YOU IF YOU'RE DONE - this is user-oriented

The time it takes is also predictable - not like the last one where it depended upon luck!
