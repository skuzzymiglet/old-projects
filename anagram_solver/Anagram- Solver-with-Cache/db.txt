How it will work:

1 The anagram solver will atempt to solve a unique sequence of letters*
* erb and erba would be different, erb and ber the same

2 It takes all scrambles of that (obtained in output) and adds them to the "scrambles" column in the DB

3 It puts all the solutions in the other column

4 When someone searches for their anagram, the computer searches the DB for solutions
